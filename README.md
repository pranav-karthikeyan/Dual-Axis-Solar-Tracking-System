# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracking-System
An IoT-based dual-axis solar panel tracking system built using ESP32 to maximize solar energy efficiency by aligning with the sunâ€™s position throughout the day. The system continuously adjusts both azimuth and elevation angles for optimal orientation. Integrated with the web integration for real-time monitoring of panel voltage and current.
